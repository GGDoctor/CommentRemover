// The objective of this project is to take the first step torwards building an interpreter, ignoring comments
// This project is developed by the following students:
// Haley Joerger
// Adam Lyday
// Jacob Franco
// Zach Gassner


// I will actually add in the code on my work computer tomorrow but
// I'm bored right now so I just started this but I need to rework it since
// he wants switch statements


#include <iostream>

//Create the suggested State
//Anything is anything that is not a comment
enum State {
    ANYTHING, 
    SLASH,
    SINGLE_LINE,
    MULTIPLE_LINE
};
